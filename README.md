# aviation-stack-api-challenge
 This is a repository created in order to do the DE interview challenge using a flight history API.
 [API Documentation](https://aviationstack.com/documentation)

## Assignment
Use the AviationStack API with the basic plan to obtain historical flight data and perform basic flight data
processing and analysis.

## Mandatory Features
- There must be an automated process to ingest and store the data. Use Python or another
programming language of your choice to develop a script or application that interacts with the
API.
- Write a function that makes a request to the API to obtain historical flight data for a specific
airline in a given date range.
- Process the received data and store it in a suitable format, such as a CSV file and a database
(SQL or NoSQL) .
- Implements functionality to filter and query the stored data. For example, it allows searching for
flights by origin, destination, airline, etc.
- Perform a basic analysis of the data obtained. You can calculate statistics such as total number
of flights, average flight duration, number of flights per airline.
- Generate visualizations using graphical libraries such as Matplotlib or Plotly to display the results
of the analysis in the form of graphs or charts.
- Document your solution, including installation and usage instructions, as well as an explanation
of the processes and decisions made during development.
